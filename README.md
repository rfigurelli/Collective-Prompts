# Collective Prompts  
**Collective Prompts** is a novel architectural framework for creating, refining, and validating prompts collaboratively in real time. It merges human intelligence, autonomous agents, and live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) testing to treat prompts not as static commands, but as living, evolving artifacts.
