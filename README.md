## 📘 Overview

**Collective Prompts** is a novel architectural framework for creating, refining, and validating prompts collaboratively in real time. It merges human intelligence, autonomous agents, and live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) testing to treat prompts not as static commands, but as living, evolving artifacts.

Prompt creation can be:
- Fully human-driven (e.g., team brainstorming),
- Fully autonomous (e.g., agentic simulation),
- Or hybrid (humans and agents collaborating interactively).

## 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ Collective prompt generation via humans, agents, or both  
- 🔄 Real-time validation with live RAG sandboxing  
- 🧩 Parallel orchestration of specialized agents (clarity, ethics, factuality, tone, etc.)  
- 📊 Consensus engine to evaluate and select optimal variants  
- 📚 Domain-agnostic and LLM-agnostic (compatible with OpenAI, Claude, open-source models, etc.)

## 💼 Use Case Examples

- **Enterprise strategy** – multi-stakeholder prompt co-creation for AI-generated business documents  
- **Scientific writing** – prompt refinement across global research collaborators with fact-checking agents  
- **Education** – teachers and students co-building tutoring prompts with pedagogical agents  
- **Legal drafting** – agents assist lawyers in prompt design for contracts and compliance  
- **UX copywriting** – real-time generation of tone-sensitive, inclusive, and SEO-optimized content
